    <p>
      I made a Quack group where we can work and chat. It will be fun. </br>
      You are invited and you should totally join. Or not. But if you don't</br>
      be warned that the rest of us will talk about you on it. What's Quack</br>
      you say? Never heard of it? Well, its like Slack, only its not, however </br>
      it rhymes with Slack, which is very important.
