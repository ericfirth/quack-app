Hi, its <%= @current_user.username %>,

I made a Quack group where we can work and chat. It will be fun.
You are invited and you should totally join. Or not. But if you don't
be warned that the rest of us will talk about you on it. What's Quack
you say? Never heard of it? Well, its like Slack, only its not, however
it rhymes with Slack, which is very important.

Join our site, just follow this link: <%= @url %>.

Thanks, see you there!
