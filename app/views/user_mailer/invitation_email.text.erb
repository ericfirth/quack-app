Hey buddy, its <%= @inviter.username.capitalize %>,

I made a Quack group called <%= @team_site.name %> where we can work and
chat. It will be fun. You are invited and you should totally join. Or not.
But be warned: if you don't the rest of us will talk about you on it.

What's Quack you say? Never heard of it? Well, its like Slack, only its not,
however it rhymes with Slack, which is very important.

Join our site, just follow this link: <%= @url %>.

Thanks, see you there!
